I'm a robotics engineer who loves getting hands-on with hardware, but what really excites me is building controllers. It’s where I get to bring together my intuition for mechanical systems and the maths that makes it all click. It’s the kind of work that challenges and drives me professionally. 

I have built a strong academic foundation through schooling - Masters in Robotics (GPA: 3.98, Dec 2024) from Northeastern University, Boston and Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering (GPA: 3.3, May 2020) from IIT Roorkee, India. To apply my academic learnings, I have worked in professional settings gaining ~2.5 years of work-experience through internships and a full-time role. Further, I am a self-learner, so to gain hands-on experience I have worked on 10+ long research projects spending more than 5000 hours, trying to learn and build.

Currenly, I am looking for full-time roles in Robotics, especially around controls where I can bring my proficient technical skills and a strong sense of ownership with work to contribute to your team. I am internally driven by my innate desire to make an impact and I'd love to join a workplace that aligns with this goal. 

Outside Academia
======
I like to stay active, try new things that scares me and explore. I recently learned sailing (at Charles River, Boston), like every other engineer I do bouldering and sometimes reading mostly self-help - "Start with Why by Simon Sinek" and "The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho" are some of my favorites. Also, in summer 2024, I did my first solo-trip traveling Thailand, Italy, Switzerland (did Via-Ferrata) and Amsterdam, currently planning for more!

I'd love to chat about anything in common whether love for robotics or outside academia, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email!
