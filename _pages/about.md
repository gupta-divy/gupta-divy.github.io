I’m a robotics engineer who loves getting hands-on with hardware, but what really excites me is building controllers. It’s where I get to combine my intuition for mechanical systems with underlying maths and physics. It’s the kind of work that keeps challenges and excites me.

I’ve built a solid academic foundation with a Master’s in Robotics (GPA: 3.98, Dec 2024) from Northeastern University, Boston, and a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering (GPA: 3.3, May 2020) from IIT Roorkee, India. Along the way, I’ve gained about 2.5 years of work-experience through internships and a full-time role. On top of that, I’m a self-learner, who has spent over 5,000 hours working on 10+ long research projects to learn and build things from ground up.

Right now, I’m looking for a full-time role in robotics, especially in controls, where I can bring my technical skills and strong sense of ownership to your team. I’m driven by the desire to make a real impact, and I’d love to work with a workplace that shares that same vision.

Outside Academia
======
I like to stay active, try new things that scares me and explore. I recently learned sailing (at Charles River, Boston), like every other engineer I do bouldering and sometimes reading mostly self-help - "Start with Why by Simon Sinek" and "The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho" are some of my favorites. Also, in summer 2024, I did my first solo-trip traveling Thailand, Italy, Switzerland (did Via-Ferrata) and Amsterdam, currently planning for more!

I'd love to chat about anything in common whether love for robotics or outside academia, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or email!
