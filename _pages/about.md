I'm a final year masters student at Northeastern University with a passion for medical and bio-mimetic robotics. My research interests lies in the field of control system and mechanical design.  

Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in robotics at Northeastern University (GPA 3.96), with a thesis in the domain of Design and Control (Deep-Learning based control) of an Ankle Exoskeleton. 

In the long run, I want to work on radical innovations that can have a direct positive impact to the environment or to its people. 

Current project
======
I am designing an Ankle Exoskeleton along with a deep-learning based task-agnostic controller under the guidance of [Prof. Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-maxwell/). In this project, I am leveraging composite flexures to design an ankle exoskeleton that does not restrict natural ankle joint movement while assisting with different ambulation tasks. In addition to the design, we are using a data-driven apporach to design a subject and task independent controller. This project has been an ideal learning opportunity for me where I explore novel controllers and mechanism while fulfilling my innate desire to make meaningful impact through research.

Apart from my interests in rehabilitation robotics, I am inspired to work on legged robots, utilizing non-linear control theory to achieve graceful and organic movements in these systems. As part of this pursuit, I am currently working on a personal projectâ€”a morphing bipedal robot that switches between rolling and bipedal motion as an efficient means of navigating the environment. I'm excited to share updates on this project soon! 

Outside Academia
======
I like to stay active and learn new things. I'm an avid swimmer, bouldering enthusiast, and loves poker. Apart from that, I'm a huge fan of reading books and trying out new restaurants. After all, life is all about balance!
