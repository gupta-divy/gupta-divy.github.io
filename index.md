I am a Mechanical design engineer transitioning to control-systems, enabling robots to employ bio-inspired efficient movements. Working at this crux of hardware and software really excites me, and I aspire to build a deeper understanding on this topic through my master's at Northeastern University in MS Robotics (Fall'22 - Present). Currently, I am working on the design and control of an Ankle Exoskeleton with [Prof. Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-maxwell/) and assiting with course ME7374-Wearable Robotics as "Course Assistant".

Prior to my graduate studies, I received my B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India in 2020 and have worked for more than a year as a Robotics Design Engineer at [OttonomyIO](https://ottonomy.io/), an autonomous delivery robot startup. 

I worked on the design of the robot and supervised its production. Also, I undertook some programming and testing tasks as part of R&D projects.
