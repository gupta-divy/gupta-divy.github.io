Hey there, I'm a robotics engineer with a passion for all things robotics! As someone who has always been fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software, transitioning to control-systems was a no-brainer for me. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in MS Robotics at Northeastern University, where I'm learning everything there is to know about enabling robots to employ natural looking movements.

Currently, I am developing an Ankle Exoskeleton with deep-learning based task-agnostic controller under the guidance of [Prof. Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-maxwell/), and I'm also assisting with the course ME7374-Wearable Robotics as a Course Assistant. The opportunity to develop novel controllers and mechanisms is what drew me to this line of work, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in the rapidly advancing field of robotics.

Before starting my graduate studies, I received my B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India, and worked as a Robotics Design Engineer at [OttonomyIO](https://ottonomy.io/) - an autonomous delivery robot startup. Through these experiences I have developed a comprehensive skillset spanning CAD modeling and prototyping, programming control systems, state estimation and machine learning. 

Beyond my passion for robotics, I like to stay active and learn new things. I'm an avid swimmer, and I'm currently learning poker theory, which has been a lot of fun. Apart from that, I'm a huge fan of reading books and trying out new restaurants. After all, life is all about balance!

So, if you're interested in the exciting world of control systems and robotics or just want to chat about anything in common, feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect with you and see where our shared passion takes us.
