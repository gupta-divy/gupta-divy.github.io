Hey there! I'm a robotics engineer with a deep passion for all things robotics. The intersection of hardware and software has always fascinated me, and it's in the field of robotics that I've found my true calling. Currently, I'm pursuing a master's degree in MS Robotics at Northeastern University, where I have a GPA of 3.96. In the long run, I want to work on radical innovations that can have a direct positive impact to the environment or to its people. 

Prior to starting my graduate studies, I received my B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India, and worked as a Robotics Design Engineer at [OttonomyIO](https://ottonomy.io/) - an autonomous delivery robot startup. Through these experiences I have developed a comprehensive skillset spanning CAD modeling and prototyping, programming control systems, state estimation, and machine learning. 

Currently, I am designing an Ankle Exoskeleton along with a deep-learning based task-agnostic controller under the guidance of [Prof. Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-maxwell/). In this project, I am leveraging material and design compliancy to design an ankle exoskeleton that do not restrict natural ankle joint movement while assisting with ambulation tasks. In addition to the design, we are using a data-driven apporach to design a subject and task independent controller for ankle-exoskeleton. This project has been an ideal learning opportunity for me where I explore novel controllers and mechanism while fulfilling my innate desire to make meaningful impact through research.

Apart from my interests in rehabilitation robotics, I am inspired to work on legged robots, utilizing non-linear control theory to achieve graceful and organic movements in these systems. As part of this pursuit, I am currently working on a personal projectâ€”a morphing bipedal robot that switches between rolling and bipedal motion as an efficient means of navigating the environment. I'm excited to share updates on this project soon! 

Beyond my passion for robotics, I like to stay active and learn new things. I'm an avid swimmer and bouldering enthusiast, which has been a lot of fun. Apart from that, I'm a huge fan of reading books and trying out new restaurants. After all, life is all about balance! 

So, if you're interested in the exciting world of robotics or just want to chat about anything in common, feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect with you and see where our shared passion takes us.
