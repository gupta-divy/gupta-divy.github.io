Hey there, I'm a robotics engineer with a passion for all things robotics! As someone who has always been fascinated by the intersection of hardware and software, I have found my motivation in control-systems. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in MS Robotics at Northeastern University, with a focus on learning tools for model-based and data-driven control methods. 

Currently, I am designing an Ankle Exoskeleton along with a deep-learning based task-agnostic controller under the guidance of [Prof. Max Shepherd](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-maxwell/). In this project, I am taking a data-driven apporach to design a subject and task independent controller for ankle-exoskeleton. The opportunity to develop novel controller and along with an innate desire to make an impact through research motivated me to work on this project. Apart, from my interests in rehabilitation robotics, I am deeply inpired to work on legged robots, where I can leveraging non-linear control theory to achieve natural looking movements in legged systems. To explore this interest, I am working on apersonal project - hybrid zero dynamics based controller for bipedal robots. I have been successfull in employing this to a 3-link planar biped, and now I am working to extend this to RABBIT. 

Before starting my graduate studies, I received my B.Tech. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India, and worked as a Robotics Design Engineer at [OttonomyIO](https://ottonomy.io/) - an autonomous delivery robot startup. Through these experiences I have developed a comprehensive skillset spanning CAD modeling and prototyping, programming control systems, state estimation and machine learning. 

Beyond my passion for robotics, I like to stay active and learn new things. I'm an avid swimmer, and I'm currently learning poker theory, which has been a lot of fun. Apart from that, I'm a huge fan of reading books and trying out new restaurants. After all, life is all about balance!

So, if you're interested in the exciting world of control systems and robotics or just want to chat about anything in common, feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect with you and see where our shared passion takes us.
