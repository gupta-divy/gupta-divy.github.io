I am a Mechanical design engineer transitioning to control-systems, enabling robots to employ bio-inspired efficient movements. Working at this crux of hardware and software really excites me, and I aspire to build a deeper understanding on this topic through my master's at Northeastern University in MS Robotics (Fall'22 - Present). Currently, I am working on the design and control of an Ankle Exoskeleton with Prof. Max Shepherd(https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/shepherd-maxwell/).

Before starting my graduate studies at Northeastern University, I have worked as a Robotics Engineer for more than one year at [OttonomyIO](https://ottonomy.io/), an autonomous delivery robot startup. I handled the design and fabrication of the robot and also undertook some programming and testing tasks as part of R&D projects.

Apart from work, I really enjoy getting creative with dishes, exploring museums, and video games (RPGs).
