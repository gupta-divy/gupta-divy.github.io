I am a Mechanical design engineer transitioning to control-systems, enabling robots to mimic bio-inspired efficient movements. Working at this crux of hardware and software engineering really excites me, and I aspire to build a deeper understanding on this topic through my master's at Northeastern University in MS Robotics (Fall'22 - Present). Apart from work, I enjoy cooking, sketching, hiking and swimming.
