title:  "Redesigned Crutches"

Currently available crutches do not have the provision of weight distribution due to which long term use of these leads to intense pressure at one point – Wrist, Elbow, or Underarms. This intense pressure at individual points may lead to following medical conditions – Crutch Palsy, Wrist Injury, Artery Damage. To overcome these problems we redesigned the crutches by leveraging the dynamics of double inverted pendulum observed during the crutch swing phase. Our design enabled approximately 60% load transfer from these pressure points to stable pelvis area.


## Prevalence of problem
Lack of training among crutch users increases risk for medical conditions due to improper posture while walking with crutch. In India, approximately 13.5 million people are more prone to risk of crutch palsy and similar conditions due to improper crutch handling. 

o 4.1% of India’s population has locomotor disability
o 30% of locomotor disabled uses crutches
o 80% of these don’t have proper medical training
